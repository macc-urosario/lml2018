    "Sometimes you make a mistake when writing code.  Rather than crash, the program should fail gracefully, preferably with an informative error message.  These types of considerations are called *exception handling*.  A good way to deal with this in `python` is to use the `try-except` block.  Once again, we won't go deep here.  We'll just show you the basic structure and enthusiastically encourage you to use it when necessary.\n",

    "### Python Classes, Modules, and Libraries\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Classes/Objects\n",
    "In true object oriented programming (OOP), the developer writes code around things called objects.  An object (or a class) groups together data and functions that operate on that data.  You might know this terminology from *C++* and other languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, maybe I have one function that calculates the area of a circle and another function that calculates the perimiter.  I could group these two functions together, along with data about the circle into a class called `circle`.\n",
    "A user can create a particular circle by *instantiating* a `circle` oject, as we do below.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from shapes import circle\n",
    "my_circle = circle(r=5)\n",
    "circle_area = my_circle.area()\n",
    "circle_perimiter = my_circle.perimiter()\n",
    "```\n",
    "When a function is part of an object it is called a *method* instead of a function. Notice that methods are accessed using the *dot* notation.\n",
    "**What really matters for this class is that we will often create an object and use the methods associated with it without having to worry about the object's internal workings**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Modules\n",
    "Modules in python contain a bunch of code that logically fits together. Most often this is a bunch of classes and functions that address a particular need. For example, there could be a `shapes.py` file that contains the `circle` class used above, as well as a `triangle` class and maybe even a `will_they_fit` function to tell if one shape can fit inside another. That .py file would then be called a module, and we could import from it.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we only want particular portions of a module, we use the from ___ import ___ syntax above. If we want the whole module, we can do this:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import shapes\n",
    "my_circle = shapes.circle(r=5)\n",
    "my_triangle = shapes.triangle(3,4,5)\n",
    "circle_area = my_circle.area()\n",
    "fit_flag = shapes.will_they_fit(my_circle, my_triangle)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Libraries\n",
    "Libraries may contain a bunch of modules that go together.  A library usually has a specific directory structure.  We won't discuss these further here, becuase as a user you only need to know about the import syntax above."

    "### Background and Motivation\n",
    "*Regular Expressions* (a.k.a. `regex` or `regexp`) are a tool for working with and manipulating text data.  We've already done some text manipulation in this lab.  We've shied away from particularly thorny examples until now.  Using `python`'s string methods is useful, but that approach has it's limitations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Regular expressions provide a set of rules for working with text data.  At first, these expressions look completely foreign (e.g. `([0-9]+(\\.[0-9]+){3})`), but once you know some of the basics they're not so bad.\n",
    "\n",
    "As it turns out, the fundamentals of regular expressions are based upon abstract algebra.  Mathematicians have studied regular expressions simply to lay down and understand their theoretical underpinnings.  We won't go anywhere near that level of detail.  For us, regular expressions will simply be used to process some gnarly text data.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a few key `regex` patterns and concepts that you must know and be comfortable with.  That fact is, there are many ways to create a `regex` to search for a particular pattern.  Some approaches are more succinct than others.  As with most things, you will get better the more you practice.  You should try to make your `regex` patterns as crisp as possible while still mainting readabilty.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Some resources\n",
    "In order to become proficient with `regex`s, you are **strongly encouraged** to take the *RegexOne* tutorial at [https://regexone.com/](https://regexone.com/).  That tutorial is an interactive and accessible introduction to regular expressions and it can be done in an hour.  It contains problems at the end to test your knowledge.  The *RegexOne* website also contains a very nice demo for `Python3`.  This lab will borrow from the *RegexOne* `python` demo to walk you through some concepts.\n",
    "\n",
    "You may also want to consider the book [Mastering Regular Expressions](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596528126.do) for more details as well as some historical comments.\n",

Creating informative visuals is an involved process and we won't cover that in this lab.  However, part of creating informative data visualizations means generating *readable* figures.  If people can't read your figures or have a difficult time interpreting them, they won't understand the results of your work.  Here are some non-negotiable commandments for any plot:\n",

    "* Include a legend if necessary\n",

Some people recommend never using gridlines, while others insist on them being present.  The correct approach is probably somewhere in between.  Use gridlines when necessary, but dispense with them when they take away more than they provide.  Ask yourself if they help bring out some important conclusion from the plot.  If not, then best just keep them away.\n",

In fact, I don't usually generate my plots with this interface.  I work with slightly lower-level methods, which I will introduce to you now.  The reason I need to make a big deal about this is because the lower-level methods have a slightly different API.  This will become apparent in my next example."
